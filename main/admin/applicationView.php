          - basically, this will display all the application forms that the user has sent so that the ADMIN can review it
          - what displayed in the application forms table depends on what filter is selected:
               - e.g. pending application forms only shows pendi- you get the point.
               - holy brocolli i need to stop being overspecific
          - the row has the following display:
               - application form id
               - application recepient
               - application status
               - dropdown element
          - admin has the following controls:
               - row clicked: shows the information of the application form
               - dropdown action:
                    - approve
                         - opens a modal to give the approved form a schedule and an additional note
                         - sends an SMS notification to the user (API)
                    - reject
                         - opens a modal to send a note about the reason why the form is rejected
                    - concluded (?) i dunno the term
